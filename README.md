# MastodonPrivacyGuide

A guide on data protection obligations, challenges & pitfalls for Mastodon Users & Instance owners / admins.

## Who Are You and Why Should I Trust You?
Name is Carey (@privacat@freeradical.zone / @privacat on the Birdsite) and I am an External Data Protection Consultant, researcher, and general buzzkill who focuses on helping organisations and individuals understand and comply with data protection laws. I work for a small outfit out of Dublin, Ireland, [Castlebridge](castlebridge.ie).

I've been in this space for a few years now, and like to think I know my way around data protection and privacy. That said, I am a consultant, and not a lawyer. **This is not, and should never be considered legal advice**. More like a helpful guide. A few caveats:
- I do not know all the laws around the world. Therefore, if you're outside of the EU/US, your local laws are controlling.
- This is designed to offer general guidance, not specific legal advice. If you've got some sort of exotic arrangement on your federated service, best to talk to someone about it, and not just trust some rando on the internet.
- I try to cite to sources as much as possible. But you should, when practical, also read those sources and not just trust some rando on the internet.
- Unlike computer code, the law is rarely binary in nature. Things change, scope expands, and situations vary.
- I don't care what the #absolutists say, no one will ever be 100% compliant with data protection/privacy laws, no matter what they claim.

> **Gonna say this again: I am not a lawyer. I am not your lawyer. This is not legal advice**.

## Scope

This guide is primarily targeted at Mastodon instance owners (the folks who run the instances) and users, but much of the elements will likely also apply to other #fediverse services (Matrix, Misskey, Pleroma, Pixelfeed, etc.)

I am primarily considering this from the EU POV, so the citations will heavily skew towards the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR] (gdpr-info.eu) [^1]. 

The GDPR has what's known in legal dork circles as wide subject matter & territorial scope (Art. 1, Art. 3), and so it generally applies to a wider class of people and organisations than do other laws (like the California Consumer Privacy Act, or China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)).

That said, if there's interest, I'll attempt to supplement this document for territorial-specific rules (maybe).

## But I Thought the GDPR (etc) Doesn't Apply to Me
As I mentioned in the Scope section, I hate to say it, but it probably does. Let me explain.

[Article 1 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-1-gdpr/) defines the subject matter of what's protected under the GDPR. Namely:
> This Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of **natural persons** with regard to the **processing** of **personal data** and rules relating to the free movement of personal data.

> This Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data.




## Well This is Harshing My Mellow

## Fine, Fine. The Data Protection Laws May Apply. Now What?
Things to Consider
1. It's more than just a Privacy Notice/Policy
2.

[^1]: gdpr-info.eu is a very helpful source, but it is not the authoritative source. That said, I use it a lot because it's MUCH cleaner and easier to search compared to the legislation itself, which can be found here: [REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).
